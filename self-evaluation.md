# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
- `each` is going to be useful any time I need to have my program 
access every object in an array, before it continues. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
-I need to learn more of the operators that can be used for iteration, 
and get a better conceptual understanding of how arrays can be used. 
I'm going to be doing this by studying documentation, and scheduling
 extra time to experiment and practice with arrays and iteration.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
- I was able to quickly find the information I was seeking with google
and the official ruby documentation. It was a good excersise in learning
from documentation and other engineers forum posts.
